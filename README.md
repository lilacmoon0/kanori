# Kanori

Kanori is a productivity web application designed to help users bring order to their daily lives by integrating kanban task management, time blocking, focused work sessions, and note-taking into a single, cohesive system. Inspired by the need for a mindful, all-in-one productivity tool, Kanori aims to turn chaos into flow, making it easier for users to manage tasks, track progress, and reflect on their achievements.
